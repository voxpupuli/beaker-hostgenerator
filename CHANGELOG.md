(maint) The hypervisor defaults are not overwritable
Before this change the code would pull and merge the hypervisor defaults on top of any
user provided --global-config block. This reverses the logic to use defaults only
if the key is not specified in the --global-config section. This specifically
enables overwritting the pooling_api for the vmpooler hypervisor, as it is the
only one with a default global_config() method implementation. Also added it's
respective test

(QENG-4019) Remove warning message about changing defaults

This warning message was added a while ago to inform users of an upcoming
breaking change. We're no longer certain that we'll be making the breaking
change though, so the warning is a bit misleading.

Furthermore, we're now trying to silence this message when beaker-hostgenerator
is used programatically within Beaker.

There will likely be more changes that are outlined in the linked ticket, such
as adding a new CLI switch to toggle between specific & generic platform names.

This deletes everything related to acceptance testing.

We had no tests, and we have no intentions of adding any. We started to lay out
the groundwork for acceptance testing a while ago with the "acceptance/"
directory, `beaker` test dependency, and the `acceptance` Rake task.

This commit deletes that groundwork, as it is out of date and just getting in
the way at this point.  If we decide to add acceptance tests in the future, it
will likely look different than this anyway.

(QENG-4204) Add AlwaysBeScheduling hypervisor

This commit adds a new hypervisor called 'abs' that will support
generating configurations necessary for working with CI.next and the
AlwaysBeScheduling service.

Currently, the behavior of the abs hypervisor is basically the same as
the vmpooler hypervisor. The only difference is it doesn't fixup the
nodes to support old PE versions.

Having a built-in hypervisor for ABS alleviates the need for users to
manually override the hypervisor key on each node.

(QENG-3946) Support arbitrary hypervisors

This commit allows unknown hypervisors to be specified by the user.
Previously, if the hypervisor specified by the user was not one of the
valid, built-in implementations then an error was thrown notifying the
user that an invalid hypervisor was requested.
Now, this is no longer an error, and instead the host generation will
continue as normal but there will be no hypervisor-specific
configuration. The name of the unknown hypervisor will be the value of
the hypervisor configuration of the hosts.

To implement this, we can repurpose the special `Hypervisor::None`
implementation to instead represent an unknown (but equally valid)
hypervisor. The unknown name will now be the value of `hypervisor` in
the generated config, where it used to be `hypervisor: none`.

For example:
  $ .. centos6-64{hypervisor=custom}
  ---
  HOSTS:
    centos6-64-1:
      pe_dir:
      pe_ver:
      pe_upgrade_dir:
      pe_upgrade_ver:
      platform: el-6-x86_64
      hypervisor: custom
      roles:
      - agent

(QENG-3811) Regenerate fixtures with new platforms

Our fixture generation isn't quite deterministic, and adding a new
platform somehow causes unrelated platform fixtures to be changed.

This commit deletes the entire `test/fixtures/generated` directory and
regenerates them anew, with new fixtures for the new AIX and Solaris
SPARC platforms.

```
(MAINT) Regenerate test fixtures and isolate them

Since we sorted the platforms alphabetically, the fixture generation
results in different filenames. Basically every time we modify
Data#platforms() we should regenerate the fixtures so we have all
platforms covered.

This moves the generated fixtures into a new directory called
`test/fixtures/generated/` so it's easier to work with them and not have
the manually created fixtures get in the way.

(QENG-3808) Support uppercase alphanumeric architectures

This commit adds support for uppercase-only alphanumeric architecture
bits in platform names. For example, we can support things like
"POWER", "POWER7", "S390X" instead of just "32" or "64".

Uppercase letters allow for backwards compatibility when roles are
specified, which come after the architecture bit. This implementation
relies on the fact that the role and arbitrary role characters are
only lowercase.

This allows us to distinguish between the architecture "POWER" and the
role "m" when parsing the spec "POWERm", as in "aix71-POWERm".
```
* (QENG-3377) Add --version CLI flag (2ddec220)


```
(QENG-3377) Add --version CLI flag

This commit adds a -v/--version CLI flag to print the version number.

This also refactors the flow-of-control to remove the need for the
SafeEarlyExit exception by moving all output-generating codepaths out of
the initialize method and into the execute method, and teasing apart the
--list and default generation codepaths. The execute method
now chooses the code path based on the CLI options set in initialize.

While we no longer throw a SafeEarlyExit exception, it's effectively
part of the API so we must wait until the appropriate time/release to
delete it. Existing usages of it should not be broken with the changes
in this commit.

* (maint) Decouple hypervisors from generator (aa39202e)


```
(maint) Decouple hypervisors from generator

This commit is a large refactor that teases apart the generate code from
the hypervisor code.

Previously the VMPooler hypervisor class was a subclass of the Generator
class, which was fine when there was only one hypervisor, but made it
difficult to add support for per-host/multiple hypervisors.

Now, there's a 1-to-many relationship between the Generator
(BeakerHostGenerator::Generator) and the
Hypervisors (BeakerHostGenerator::Hypervisor).

The giant map of OSINFO data that was previously in the
'data/vmpooler.rb' has been promoted and moved into data.rb as the
`osinfo` module function. The parts specific to the VMPooler hypervisor
have been nested under submaps keyed by the name of the hypervisor,
`:vmpooler`.

Adding support for a new hypervisor now requires implementing
BeakerHostGenerator::Hypervisor::Interface, and adding any appropriate
platform data as a submap to the OSINFO map in data.rb, keyed under a
symbol named after the new hypervisor (e.g. `:my_hypervisor`).

The module function `BeakerHostGenerator::Data.get_platform_info` can
then be used when implementing the hypervisor to extract the relevant
platform data under the key `:my_hypervisor`.

(QENG-3370) Fix module constant initialization bug.

Similar to the BeakerHostGenerator::Data::Vmpooler data initialization bug, this
is something that would not typically show up during normal command line usage
of beaker-hostgenerator because at that time there is typically only one
reference made to the BeakerHostGenerator::Utils module constant. However during
test fixture generation and rspec tests the modules were only loaded once so
there was only one attempt to read in environment variables which led to
inconsisten results depending on the order in which the fixtures were
generated/tested.

(QENG-3370) Fix major bug in BeakerHostGenerator::Data::Vmpooler

Since the OSINFO and OSINFO_BHGv1 module constants are only initialized once
(during library load), do not refer directly to them using reference variables.
Instead, initialize the osinfo variable directly on each call of get_osinfo and
merge in the module constants as appropriate based on the given
beaker-hostenerator version integer.

This bug never came up during normal command-line usage of beaker-hostgenerator
because get_osinfo would never be expected to be called with both bhg_version=0
and bhg_version=1. However, it came up both during generation of test fixtures
and validation of those test fixtures in rspec since the module is only loaded
once which led to the mutated value of the OSINFO module constant to persist
across all initializations of the BeakerHostGenerator::CLI class.

```
(QENG-3370) Use fixtures in rspec tests instead of minitest.

This makes it possible to treat each individual fixture its own test case which
improves the reporting and ensures that all fixtures are tested even if some
fail.

Using a loop containing an assertion in minitest did not work for this purpose
because a failed assertion caused the loop to break prematurely; it probably
would have been possible to catch whatever the exception was and continue the
loop but whatever. I already did this.

This may be necessary to ensure coverage checks can work correctly. Also, it
makes sense to test at this since I know of at least one project that is doing
something similar.

Not so sure about the way this is handling stderr though--just trying to avoid
polluting the minitest console output.

(maint) Update Windows 10 platform names

 - Previous convention for Windows platforms is to always end in a -32
   or -64.  There are some tests that rely on this naming scheme to
   properly identify a 32-bit or 64-bit OS.

   For instance, a Puppet acceptance test relies on that convention when
   detecting the location of binaries per:

   https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/acceptance/tests/ensure_puppet-agent_paths.rb#L140-L143

   Original commit that introduced these was

(QENG-3275) Ensure ruby_arch matches install_32

Previously, if then `pe_use_win32` environment variable was set, then
the resulting host config for 64-bit windows OS's, would contain
`ruby_arch: x64`, which contradicted `install_32: true`.

This commit ensures `ruby_arch: x86` in this particular case so that it
is consistent with `install_32: true`.

        template: win-2012r2-x86_64
        ruby_arch: x86

(QENG-3275) Default ruby_arch based on Windows arch

Previously, Windows host configs did not contain `ruby_arch`, which
puppet, facter, and pxp-agent rely on during acceptance tests to
detect which version of ruby is running, as we support running either
32 or 64-bit puppet on 64-bit Windows.

This commit ensures `ruby_arch` is set to x64 for 64-bit Windows, and
x86 for 32-bit Windows.

(QENG-3267) Add an execute method for programmatic execution

Previously, it was not possible to execute the CLI and get back the
output as a string.

This commit adds an `execute` method that does that, and modifies
`execute!` to print what `execute` returns, as it did before.

* (QENG-3267) Allow CLI to be called programmatically (b571680d)

(QENG-3267) Allow CLI to be called programmatically

Previously, the CLI class relied on the global ARGV which prevented
the CLI from being called programmatically.

This commit changes the initialize method to take an optional array of
arguments. If none are provided, we use the global ARGV as we did
before, although we make a duplicate of it, since we later mutate it,
e.g. pushing "--help".

* (QENG-3267) Rename Beaker::Host::Generator to BeakerHostGenerator (19455f66)


```
(QENG-3267) Rename Beaker::Host::Generator to BeakerHostGenerator

Previously, we were using the Beaker::Host::Generator namespace, where
Beaker::Host is a module, but beaker defines Beaker::Host to be a
class, so you could not require both beaker and beaker-hostgenerator.

This commit renames the module namespace to BeakerHostGenerator so
that it cannot collide with Beaker.

This is a backwards incompatible change if anyone is programmatically
calling Beaker::Host::Generator, but I don't think anyone is.
