module BeakerHostGenerator
  # Defines an Interface for the implementation of a hypervisor, and provides
  # a static module function `create(node_info, options)` for instantiating
  # the appropriate hypervisor implementation.
  #
  # New hypervisor implementations must define the methods in the Interface
  # class, and add a new element to the `builtin_hypervisors` map.
  #
  # Any number of hypervisors are used by a single Generator during host
  # generation in the `BeakerHostGenerator::Generator#generate` method.
  # Whenever a host specifies a specific hypervisor implementation, the
  # Generator will instantiate the appropriate hypervisor via
  # `BeakerHostGenerator::Hypervisor.create`.
  module Hypervisor
    # Static factory method to instantiate the appropriate hypervisor for the
    # given node. If no hypervisor is specified in the node info, then the
    # hypervisor specified in the options will be created. If the hypervisor is
    # not a built-in implementation, then an `Unknown` instance will be used.
    #
    # @param node_info [Hash{String=>Object}] Node data parsed from the input
    #                                         spec string.
    #
    # @option options [String] :hypervisor The string name of the hypervisor to
    #                          create.

    # Returns a map of all built-in hypervisor implementations, where the keys
    # are the string names and the values are the implementation classes.

    # The string names are part of the beaker-hostgenerator API as they are
    # used for specifying the default or per-host hypervisor in the layout
    # specification input string.

    #                                                and their implementations.
